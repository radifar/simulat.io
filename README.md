# Simulat.IO

Make sure you have installed docker and docker-compose, and you will need at least 2 GB of free space.

Run `docker-compose up -d --build`

Wait until building image complete and all container run and ready (may take quarter to hours depends on your PC and connection)

Open localhost:8008

To stop Simulat.IO `docker-compose down`
